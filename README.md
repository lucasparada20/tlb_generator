# tlb_generator
A generator of instances for the Target-Level Bicycle problem (TLB). In brief, the TLB is a combinatorial optimization problem that determines the optimal quantities of bikes at stations in a bike-sharing system (BSS) to maximize the number of satisfied user trips.

The generator simulates a non-homogeneous Poisson process for given bike arrival and departure rates to and from the stations. The instances can be solved by the Benders' algorithm in this [Technical Report](https://www.cirrelt.ca/documentstravail/cirrelt-2025-02.pdf)

The data is taken from the work of [Datner et al., (2017)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.2017.0790)

## Building the code in Linux

1. Clone the repository and add executable permission to a script that will compile and link for you:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lucasparada20/tlb_generator.git
cd tlb_generator
chmod u+x build_datner_gen.sh
```
2. Build the code by typing:

```bash
./build_datner_gen.sh
```

if you want to debug or use valgrind, just type:

```bash
./build_datner_gen.sh debug
```

```bash
./build_datner_gen.sh valgrind
```

Since the data is given in Matlab files, the generator uses the [Libmatio](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/libmatio) library to parse them. The build script will check if Libmatio is found in your system; otherwise, it can be installed with the following:

```bash
sudo apt install libmatio-dev
```

## Running the code

Inside the `tlb_generator` directory, you will find a script `run_datner_gen.sh` with sample command line calls. The format is:

* trips_rates_file : The path to the file containing the data for incoming and outgoing rates to the stations.
* stations_locations_file : The path to the file containing the capacities of the stations.
* nb_scenarios : The integer number of scenarios in which you want to estimate/train the algorithm.
* nb_test_scenarios : The integer number of scenarios in which you want to evaluate/test the solution.
* seed : The integer to initialize the pseudo-random generator for the Poisson process. As a good practice, set it to a high value, non-negative integer.

Following conventional Sample Average Approximation (SAA) methodologies : `nb_scenarios <<< nb_test_scenarios`. In the examples, we set nb_scenarios = 100 and nb_test_scenarios = 400.

The Poisson process is simulated in the file `MakeScenario.cpp`.

In the directory `instances_datner` you will find the instances already built (and compressed) according to the commands in the `run_datner_gen.sh`.

The data also includes the optimal solutions found by [Raviv and Kolka (2013)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0740817X.2013.770186?needAccess=true#d1e263). Upon calling the code, the generator will print them with the name of `targets_{city_name}{1or2}.txt`. Note that `targets_boston1.txt` will print out empty, as the authors in Datner et al., (2017) do not provide the solution in the data. To see this, check the output of the following code snippet:

```C
//Print output from .mat files
std::cout << "Variable name: " << varname << std::endl;
std::cout << "  Class type: " << matvar->class_type << ", Data type: " << matvar->data_type << std::endl;
std::cout << "  Rank: " << matvar->rank << std::endl;
std::cout << "  Dimensions: ";
for (int i = 0; i < matvar->rank; ++i)
	std::cout << matvar->dims[i] << " ";
std::cout << std::endl;
```

You will see that the Matlab variable **InitialState00ofer** is missing for boston1.
